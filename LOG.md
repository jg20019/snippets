# Activtiy Log

Part of the purpose of this project was to get better at being consistently working on projects.
One of the constraints of this project was to only work for 30 minutes a day for 30 minutes.

This document tracks what was worked on, on each day. I plan to look back at this document
in 30 days and (hopefully) have a decent and working project.
